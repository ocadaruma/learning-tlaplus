- Bothersome to create new TLA+ module (scaffolding is necessary)
- TLA+ doesn't show in "New file" menu (cmd N)
- Should file-name and module-rename be synced
- Operator resolution should be correctly done
  * `+, ..` operators are defined in Integers module, so they should be invisible unless we EXTENDS it
- Want the feature to pretty print the spec
